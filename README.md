Experiences

During the making of this web app, I have learned many things. Such as how to do a Password Reset, with Two Factor Verification, and how to use and generate a token on a emailed external link. Associating exercises to sets and weight and reps data to them was difficult and forced me to think more outside of the box and getting passed that hurdle, made the rest of the project much easier. This was a great experience to build and I was glad I worked on this project, I maybe deploying the server live in the future.
